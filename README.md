This is the code of my Air Quality Egg connected to an Arduino UNO and the Ethernet Shield.

This AQE with Arduino is connected to the Internet through Yaler [http://yaler.net].

You can see the data generated at (if it's alive): http://gsiot-ypf7-s06d.yaler.net/aqe.json

I also created a JSON compatible with Cosm [http://cosm.com] for being pulled by Cosm to this feed: https://cosm.com/feeds/120389
